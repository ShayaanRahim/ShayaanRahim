# Hi, I’m Shayaan

I’m a Computer Science student at UT Dallas building real, data-driven software systems.

I focus on:
- Full-stack web applications
- Machine learning & NLP
- Data pipelines, APIs, and system design

### What I’m working on
- **ProjectMe** — job market analytics + skill gap analysis for CS students
- **FundThesis** — simplified financial news & market insights for retail investors
- ML-driven tools that turn messy data into useful decisions

### Tech I use
- Python, TypeScript, SQL
- React / Next.js, FastAPI
- PostgreSQL, Supabase
- ML/NLP (classification, extraction, evaluation)

I learn by building, shipping, and iterating on real problems.
